## The 'Validate converted XForm with ODK Validate' option is disabled. How do I enable it?

ODK Validate needs Java to be installed and available in your PATH. 

If you don't have Java installed, download it from http://java.com/en/download.

If after you install and reboot, you still cannot validate, it is likely you do not have Java in your PATH. Follow the instructions at http://java.com/en/download/help/path.xml to add Java to your PATH.



## ODK XLSForm Offline.app cannot be opened. It says it is from an unidentified developer.

This message is from Gatekeeper (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290), a feature in Mac OS X 10.7 and later that helps protect your Mac from malware and misbehaving apps downloaded from the Internet.

To allow your Mac to run ODK XLSForm Offline.app, follow these three steps.

1. In Finder, Control-click or right-click the ODK XLSForm Offline.app icon.
2. Select Open from the top of contextual menu that appears.
3. Click Open in the dialog box. If prompted, enter an administrator name and password.

You only have to do this once. ODK XLSForm Offline.app will now run without the warning from Gatekeeper.
